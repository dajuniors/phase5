# Our Mission Statement:

Enhance our coding skills for future software development jobs and create an awesome project that can make the world a better place.

# Our Problem Statement:

Have you ever been in a situation where you could not find the bathroom? As a legend (Elmo) once taught us all, when you gotta go, you gotta go! All of us have had potty emergencies but have not always known where the nearest bathroom is. We want to create a solution for those in dire situations when finding a bathroom is necessary.

# OneRestroomAway application:
The OneRestroomAway webpage provides a portal for you to find the nearest bathroom to your current location. You will have the ability to search for restrooms around you as long as your allow the webpage to use your current location.

Currently, the page is only able to find restrooms based within the University of Washington - Seattle campus, but will be updated for future releases to expand its restroom search area. As such, the app is currently tailored towards use on the University of Washington - Seattle campus. Searching for restrooms outside of the University of Washington - Seattle campus will not provide useful results.
